# Project-1

# Created by Alyssa Hollowell, Kennedy Oginga, Diego Hernandez 

# Project Description

We have created an application that allows users to search for a product that they are interested in and do a price match to figure out where the product is the cheapest and click a link which takes them to the product they want to purchase. Our application is user friendly making it simple for the user to search for their product in a timely manner. 

# Files included 
index.html, script.js, and style.css. We also used materialize css framework.
